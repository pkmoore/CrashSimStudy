\section{Evaluation}
\label{SEC:evaluation}

To be able to evaluate how CrashSimulator performs, a series of tests were
conducted using a prototype build on {\tt rr} version 5.2.0 running on a
32-bit Linux kernel running distributed with  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  Our
modifications to {\tt rr} were carried out in C++ and the CrashSimulator
supervisor was implemented in ZZZZ lines of Python 2.7 code with a YYYY
line C extension that allows it to interact with processes using the {\tt
Ptrace} API.  This version of CrashSimulator is available as a Docker
container and, due to some operating system configuration being necessary,
is most easily installed in this fashion.

For a test environment, we chose
a vmware virtual machine running version of CrashSimulator described above.
We ran the tests on a 1.7 gHz
core i7 system with 8GB of RAM. Our implementation used {\tt ptrace} to
interpose on the running program and interject anomalous behavior into its
execution.  To our knowledge, the only major negative impact of
these design choices was that the use of {\tt ptrace} and Python did slow
down our
prototype's performance.  On the positive side, it simplified construction.
As will be discussed later, much of this performance
degradation is offset by the highly asynchronous fashion in which our
prototype can execute tests.

Part of our evaluation consisted of a user study involving
12 participants from a computer science master's
program.  These students had varying backgrounds in relation to software
development and automated testing.  All received  12.5 hours
of instruction and assistance using CrashSimulator.
This training focused on the tools'
initial setup, configuration, and usage,
as well as on how to interpret its
results.

We asked our participants to test popular real-world applications with the
goal of identifying new bugs and reporting them to the application's
developers.  In performing this task our participants had to correctly set
up and configure CrashSimulator, execute a testing process, evaluate the
results, and produce a sufficient proof of validity for each bug to
convincingly support the case for fixing it.
To focus this process on the actual but finding and fixing
process, rather than open source development meta-concerns, participants
were encouraged, but not limited to, testing applications listed highly on
the Debian popularity contest.  These applications are more likely to have
clean, mature code bases and active developer communities reducing the
barrier to entry for our participants.

With our prototype in hand, we
set out to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Is CrashSimulator able to identify a wide variety of environmental
    bugs?
(Subsection~\ref{sec-env-bugs})}

\item{What work is involved in supporting new anomalies and applications?
    (Subsection~\ref{sec-new-anom-app})}

\item{Do tests using CrashSimulator make yield too many false positives?
      (Subsection~\ref{sec-sorts-errors})}

\item{Can CrashSimulator
      execute tests efficiently? (Subsection~\ref{sec-perf})}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Is CrashSimulator able to identify a wide variety of
environmental bugs?}
\label{sec-env-bugs}

The most crucial question to ask about CrashSimulator is how readily it can
identify environmental bugs from a wide variety of causes.  To evaluate the
tool in this regard we configured the tool to look for bugs from the
categories discussed in Section~\ref{SEC:background}. \texbf{CHECK THIS} These bugs included
a filesystem bug involving unusual filesystem and network situations under
Linux.
All of these bugs relied on common API calls, and thus had the potential to
appear in many programs.  We selected the tested applications either
because they were deemed ``popular'' by Debian's Popularity
Contest~\cite{DebPopCon}, or were from GNU Coreutils.  Coreutils
applications were chosen because of their widespread inclusion in many
Linux distributions.


\subsubsection{Bugs Related to Moving Files}

As was discussed in Section~\ref{SEC:background}, the first bug finding
opportunity offered by AES is after analyzing an applications unmodified
system call behavior.  To evaluate CrashSimulator's ability to find bugs at
this point, we employed it in analyzing applications as they move files
about on the filesystem.  In many cases this operation can be handled
atomically by the operating system through the {\tt rename()} system call.
However, in situations where the source file and destination file are on
different storage devices, the application performing the operation must
manually perform all of the steps required to successfully move a file.
This is a situation that even well-tested applications
frequently get wrong~\cite{PHPRenameBug,PythonShutilBug,NodejsCopyBug}.

{\bf Method.}  Catching this particular bug requires CrashSimulator to use
a checker that encodes the correct steps involved in moving a file from one
storage device to another. To identify these steps
we examined several libraries and applications and found that {\tt mv} seemed
to handle cases that other tools failed to consider.  Following this, we
used the trace of {\tt mv} as a template to create an checker that
evaluates whether or not the application performs the following
checks and operations:

\paragraph{Source Replaced}

An application should make an effort to ensure that the file being copied is not
replaced between the time it is initially examined and the time it is opened
for copying.  Otherwise it could have been replaced by a file of a different
type, such as a character device.

To test whether applications are robust to anomalies involving source file replacement,
we developed a checker that monitors whether a series of safety checks
are performed and applied it to traces that simulated a cross-device move.
Failing to perform these checks often results in corruption of the file~\cite{PythonShutilBug}.

\paragraph{Preserve Xattrs}

Extended file attributes are used by modern
operating systems to store descriptive information about a file that cannot be
held by normal filesystem fields.  For example, an operating system can use
extended file attributes to record whether or not a file was downloaded from the
Internet -- important security information that warn
users if they are about to open a potentially unsafe file.  Apple's Gatekeeper
relies on extended file attributes to prevent the execution of applications downloaded from
untrusted developers without explicit user action~\cite{AppleCodeSigning}.
When copying a file,
an application should retrieve extended file attributes from the source
file and, later, apply them to the destination file.
In this case, CrashSimulator used a checker
that watches for the application to make system calls
that read the extended file attributes from the source file (i.e. {\tt
  getxattr()}, {\tt lgetxattr()}, or {\tt fgetxattr()}) followed by system calls
that re-apply the attributes to the destination file (i.e. {\tt setxattr()},
{\tt lsetxattr()}, or {\tt fsetxattr()}).

\paragraph{Preserve Timestamps}

In order to truly copy a file from one device
to another an application needs to ensure that its metadata (such as the
creation, modification, and access times) are preserved in the destination
file.
In this case, the checker monitors
whether when replaying a trace modified to simulate cross-device move,
the application applies
the appropriate timestamps to the destination file as part of moving a file
across devices by monitoring for a system call from the {\tt stat()} family to
retrieve the timestamps and system call from the {\tt utime()} family to apply
the retrieved timestamps to the destination file.
Failure to preserve timestamps has obvious
implications in records-keeping and archival situations as well as any situation
where a chronological record of file manipulations is important.  This can
cause odd behavior in Makefiles, archival programs, and similar
software~\cite{NautilusTimestamps, SudoTimestamp}.

\paragraph{Copying Devices}

It is also important to check if a move would attempt to copy a special
character file like {\tt /dev/urandom} across disks.  As was discussed in the
previous section, many applications fail to examine the nature of a file before
operating on it.  So the file must be moved by creating a new device of the same
type at the destination, instead of reading from a potentially infinite device.
In our experience, applications that fail to perform this check end up
completely filling a disk or exhausting available memory -- sometimes causing the
system to become unresponsive.

      they are able to correctly move a file from one device to another.
Incorrect entries are either missing the needed check or were ineffective.}
    \label{table:crossdevice}
\end{table}

{\bf Findings.}
As can be seen from the results in Table~\ref{table:crossdevice}, each of the
applications tested fails to perform one or more of the steps required to
successfully complete a cross-device move.  This is an unfortunate situation
because a failure to perform any one of these steps can result in negative
outcomes for the system as a whole.

Our results indicate that CrashSimulator is able to identify whether complex
operations are performed correctly in anomalous situations in
an array of popular programs.
This includes the standard libraries for the programming languages Python,
Perl, and Rust, along with other widely used software.  This is true even
when many libraries have correct behavior in some cases, but not others.
CrashSimulator is effective at finding the anomalous behaviors in these
cases.


\preston{Need paragraph here talking about finding bugs by injecting}

\subsubsection{Unexpected File Types}
\label{sec-file-type-bugs}
Providing unexpected types of files to
applications.

The first anomaly investigated occurs when an application has to retrieve
and process data from a file.  Linux supports several ``special'' file
types apart from the standard ``regular'' file type, such as
directories, symbolic links, character devices, block devices, sockets, and
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) pipes.  While these special files
use the same system calls as regular files (such as {\tt read()} and
{\tt write()}), they behave in very different ways.  For example, {\tt
/dev/urandom} is a character device that produces an infinite amount of
pseudo-random data when read.  If an application that reads the full
contents of a file before processing it is provided {\tt /dev/urandom}, it
will fill memory or disk space and could
crash the system~\cite{YumAptEndless}.
Correct execution in these situations often requires applications
to examine the files in order to ensure they are of an appropriate type.

{\bf Method.}  Identifying these bugs involves changing an application's
execution trace to induce its response to an unexpected file type.  For
example, the {\tt sed} application, which modifies the contents of a text
file according to a provided command string, could be provided a symbolic
link, a directory, or a character device instead.  CrashSimulator
accomplishes this by identifying the calls to {\tt stat()}, {\tt fstat()},
or {\tt lstat()} that an application makes to examine the file, and then
changes the trace to simulate
one of the special file types.  If the application responds to
this injected information then there is the possibility that the special
file will be handled correctly.  On the other hand, if there is no
alteration in the behavior of the application,  then the condition is not
being handled correctly.

{\bf Findings.}
The results of this round of tests were shown in
Table~\ref{table:unexpectedtypes}.

For each application, CrashSimulator was invoked multiple times,and
the trace was modified
to simulate each of the non-standard file type anomalies.  Some
of the applications opened multiple files; in these cases each anomaly was
simulated for each of the file arguments to the application.
Table~\ref{table:unexpectedtypes} also shows the values that CrashSimulator
inserts into the return value of the {\tt stat()}-like call,
in response to
different file type anomalies.  A result of ``Initial Value'' indicates
that this is the file type the application was provided when the replayed
execution trace was recorded -- that is, a file of the type the application
was expecting.  A result of ``Recognizes'' indicates that the application
identified that it was being provided with an unexpected file type and its
execution diverged, indicating that it was potentially handling the
unexpected file type correctly.  A result of ``Fail'' indicates that the
application failed to recognize the presence of the unusual file type
because execution never diverged from the trace being replayed.  We
manually examined a subset of the listed application behaviors simulated by
CrashSimulator and verified they were consistent with the actual behavior
on the given file type.

    \caption{Applications tested for their handling of unexpected file types.  A

    ``Fail'' indicates that the application failed to recognize the presence of
    an unusual file and attempted to process it.}
    \label{table:unexpectedtypes}
\end{table*}

The frequency of failed executions in our results indicate that many
applications make the assumption that they will only be used to process
regular files.  When this assumption does not hold, execution results
can be hard to predict.  In many cases a denial of
service condition occurs in the form of the application ``hanging,'' as it
attempts to incorrectly process the file.  This may happen harmlessly, such
as if an application blocks forever waiting for a {\tt read()}
call to retrieve non-existent data from an empty FIFO, or harmfully, as
when an application attempts to read in and process an
``infinitely large'' file, that will eventually fill all
available memory or disk
space~\cite{Cappos_CCS_08}.

Of particular interest is the behavior we see in the last two applications
listed in Table~\ref{table:unexpectedtypes}.  Each application correctly
recognized when an unexpected file type was encountered, as they
are simply ``dumb'' wrappers around the system calls
with which they share a name.  As such, they essentially,
they just hand the specified
file to their corresponding system call and, in the case of an error, use
{\tt perror()} to print the correct localized error message.  In short,
these applications pass their error handling responsibilities to the
kernel.

      anomalous conditions.  The IFCHR file used was the infinite-length {\tt
        /dev/urandom}.}
    \label{table:applicationresponses}
\end{table}


In order to confirm the accuracy of CrashSimulator's assessments we manually
exposed a subset of the Coreutils applications we tested to the unusual file
types to get an idea of how they would respond.
Table~\ref{table:applicationresponses} contains the results of this test.
CrashSimulator's evaluation of an application can map to real world bug behavior
in a few different combinations
One
possibility is that CrashSimulator asserts that the application will fail
and in practice it does.  This is the case when we evaluated
the response of  {\tt install} when it was provided a character device
rather than a regular file. CrashSimulator predicted failure and the
application ended up filling the disk of the machine on which it was run.  The
opposite can also occur.  That is, CrashSimulator reports that the
application detected the anomalous condition and the application manages to
do so in practice,  as when we evaluated {\tt wc}'s response to
being run on a directory.

There were however, a few times when CrashSimulator and the
application's response disagreed.  This
happened when we evaluated {\tt ptx}'s response to an
infinite-sized character device.  CrashSimulator reported that {\tt ptx}
had correctly responded to the anomaly.  But in reality, {\tt ptx} filled the
disk of the the test machine.
Overall, the results of this ``real world'' analysis
support the claim that CrashSimulator can identify real bugs that can have
damaging consequences.

\preston{Need paragraph here talking about how CrashSimulator is not
limited to filesystem bugs.  We can find this network bug with at both
points}

\subsubsection{Slowloris attack} Delaying network applications for extended
periods.
\label{sec-timeout-bugs}


The second anomaly we examined involves an application's behavior when it
attempts to communicate over a network with extremely long (on the order of
minutes) response times.  At a low level, applications retrieve data from a
network socket by waiting for data to be available and then reading it.  A
key aspect of this approach is handling the situation where communication
takes too long and should time out.

{\bf Method.} CrashSimulator can detect whether an application is
vulnerable to this attack by modifying the trace to simulate large
amounts of time elapsing between network operations.  In this approach,
CrashSimulator determines whether or not the application makes any effort
to configure its network communications with a timeout value. This is done
by examining the presence or absence of {\tt setsockopt()}, {\tt poll()}
and {\tt select()} calls as well as the timeout values that may or may not
have been passed to them. Applications that do not set the timeout are
subject to the operating system-defined protocol timeout value (19 minutes
on Linux).  Note that by properly manipulating the results of all
time-returning calls, CrashSimulator can simulate an execution where close
to the maximum timeout value occurs, without actually spending any time
waiting.


Again, our selection of network applications and libraries were based on
those that were
most popular on Debian's ratings~\cite{DebPopCon}.

\begin{table}[t]

    \bottomrule{}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Applications tested for their handling of extremely slow response
    times from the host with which they are communicating }
  \label{table:slowloris}
\end{table}


{\bf Findings.} As Table~\ref{table:slowloris} shows, all of these
applications were vulnerable to this sort of anomaly, with timeouts taking
hours or even days in some cases to resolve.
What's more, in the vast majority of
cases, the problem occurs because the application makes no effort to
specify a timeout value.  This means an attacker can transmit one byte of
data per timeout period (per Linux's value of 19 minutes for TCP sockets),
allowing them to keep the application alive instead of quitting.


This attack technique has been effectively exploited in the wild.  The {\tt
slowloris} tool allows a single attacking host to successfully deny service
to a vulnerable web server with minimal bandwidth usage by simply
introducing delays between the headers sent to the victim by an attacking
HTTP client.  Because many web servers at the time  of {\tt slowloris's} release
allowed large timeouts
between messages from the clients, one web client could effectively tie up
the resources of a web server for a long period of time.
This can cause a slow buildup of unending or long lived jobs that consume
resources and cause detrimental system behavior~\cite{Slowloris}.
Similar attacks can be used to indefinitely delay security updates to
clients, leaving them vulnerable to compromise~\cite{Cappos_TR_08}.

\subsubsection{Bugs Found By Participants}

Another topic of relevance in answering this question is how well new users are
able to find bugs with CrashSimulator.
To answer this question we can examine the bug finding results from our user
study.
A total of eleven bugs further bugs were found by participants using
CrashSimulator.  Of these, nine were found using the ``Unusual Filetype.''
Five of these bugs have been reported to the appropriate maintainers.
Three of these reports contained patches constructed by the submitter.

{\bf Discussion. }

The above results indicate that participants
not involved in the development of
CrashSimulator are able to use it to find new bugs in real world
applications.  Participants commented that narrowing the source of a bug
down to a particular sequence of system calls
was helpful in identifying the area of
code responsible for the bug decreasing the time required to produce a fix.
Observation showed that familiarity with operating systems concepts
very beneficial when working with CrashSimulator.  At
the same time, most participants were
able to identify bugs by using its built in corpus of
anomalies. ~\ref{table:fig-tool-anomaly} shows which
of these anomalies most commonly
resulted in application bugs.

This effort revealed shortcomings with the tool.  First,  there can be
confusion around what application behaviors constitute a bug.  For example,
it may be the intention of an application's developer that the application
run forever when processing an ``infinitely long'' file.  Additionally, it
simply reporting that an application did or did not change its behavior in
the presence of an anomaly is insufficient if CrashSimulator's user is
unfamiliar what a result means.  Both of these issues are being corrected
by improving the CrashSimulator's output so that it more clearly describes
the nature of a given result and why the user should be concerned.

  \label{fig-tool-anomaly}
\end{figure}

{\bf Concluding Thoughts} The results of the above analysis show that
CrashSimulator is readily able to identify novel bugs in widely used
applications, including security-focused applications like gnu-gpg, and a host
of popular network applications, by following a repeatable and principled
protocol.


\subsection{What work is involved in supporting new anomalies and
applications?}
\label{sec-new-anom-app}

\subsubsection{Supporting New Applications}
{\bf Discussion.} Work using our prototype of CrashSimulator showed that
it is able to test most
applications that are able to run on a setup that supports CrashSimulator
regardless of common testing impediments like programming language
differences or dependency issues.  This is primarily due to such
applications interacting with their environment through system calls.
CrashSimulator supports YYYY of the most commonly utilized system calls and
provides helpful output when an unsupported system call is encountered.
Adding support for system calls as they are encountered has been successful
because the set of system calls used by an application is small and
static~\cite{Tsai:2016:SML:2901318.2901341}.  Using this iterative process
has allowed us to improve our prototype to the point that it can support a
large number of popular, complex applications.

{\bf Findings.}During the
course of this evaluation participants were encouraged to report
unsupported system calls should they encounter
them while using the tool.  As a result exposure to a wider range of
applications support for ten new system calls was added.  Adding support
for these system calls was simple a relatively pain free process with the
bulk of the difficulty coming down to
understanding the details of the system calls themselves rather than from
the effort of implementing support for these system calls once they were
understood.

\subsubsection{Supporting New Anomalies}

While CrashSimulator is able to test an application's response to a suite
of anomalies out of the box its capabilities can be extended to best fit
the needs of its users.
The effort and skill involved in
this process is similar to that involved in writing a unit test or
integration test using a modern testing framework.  However, unlike a unit
test or integration test, a CrashSimuator test can be run
against multiple
applications without concern for dependencies like the language in which
they were
written in or the libraries they depend on allowing its users to get more
value for the effort they put in.


\subsection{What sorts of errors does CrashSimulator make?}
\label{sec-sorts-errors}

The primary source of false positives in CrashSimulator is an application
using a different sequence of system calls to implement a given operation
than a mutator was anticipating. CrashSimulator's approach allows these
situations to be easily corrected, once identified through analysis of the
incorrect test results.  This is similar to the circumstance where an
application's test suite is missing a test, necessitating action by the
developer to construct the missing test.

For example, consider GNOME's {\tt glib} file handling facilities.  When an
application makes use of these facilities to move a file across storage
devices the library itself correctly performs a
file move operation.  When we used CrashSimulator with
mutators that expected a calls to {\tt read()} and {\tt write()}
for a cross-device move, we got reports stating that the
application {\em did not} perform the system calls necessary to inject
an anomaly.  By manually
examining a system call trace, we found that, while {\tt glib} correctly
performs the requested move operation,
it does so using alternative system call
sequences.  Rather than using a sequence of {\tt read()} and {\tt write()}
calls, as our mutator expected, {\tt glib} creates a pipe and uses the {\tt
splice()} system call to copy the contents out of the source file, through
the pipe and into the destination file.

Fortunately, as soon as issues like this are discovered,
CrashSimulator's mutators can be modified to deal with alternative
approaches to handling an anomaly.  This approach is viable because there
are a finite number of system calls, and a given operation can be mapped to
a manageable subset of system calls.  Given the above example around moving
files, consider the mapping from high level ``operation'' to the set of
system calls that can implement it in Table~\ref{table:stepsandcalls}.
Each of the steps in the operation map to a small number of system calls
and, in most cases, only one of these system calls is necessary.  In
situations where two system call sequences can correctly implement the same
operation, CrashSimulator simply runs two mutators in parallel resulting in a
test executing for the one whose prerequisites are met.

\subsection{Can CrashSimulator execute tests efficiently?}
\label{sec-perf}

One key attribute of successful testing tools is that they are able to
complete their tests in a timely manner.  If a tool takes too long,
users will be less likely to run it, which reduces its
usefulness dramatically. To this end, the performance of CrashSimulator was
evaluated in order to determine whether or not it was able to complete its
test executions in an acceptable time frame.

{\bf Method.} To determine the efficiency of CrashSimulator as a testing tool,
we examined the completion
times for executions of the specified application in both
native and replay execution modes.

        \center{}
        \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=.75]{images/performance.png}}
        \caption{\emph{This shows the run time difference between the
native program and CrashSimulator in seconds.  Each dot indicates an
        execution.  The X axis shows time values for native executions, and
        executions under CrashSimulator with 0, 5, 10, and 100 tests
        performed respectively.
}}
         \label{figure:performance}

    \end{figure}


{\bf Findings.} Overall, the performance of CrashSimulator is usually
about an order of magnitude slower than if the original program is executed
natively.  This is largely due to performance problems in our (unoptimized)
prototype, primarily our utilization of Python and {\tt ptrace} once
process sets have been liberated from {\tt rr}.  Tracing the program
with {\tt ptrace} adds up to a factor of 5x in overhead,  which could be
removed with more efficient mechanisms like {\tt eBPF} or a loadable kernel
module.  In addition, starting up the Python interpreter increases the
startup time of our prototype's supervisor.

\preston{Rewrite this paragraph to say "we found good stuff, it runs quick
enough, along we way we made a performance improvement. Mention eliding
time for I/O to happen}
Though aspects of our performance were less efficient than desired, its
ability to execute many tests throughout the course of one replay and the
lack of blocking while waiting for test completion somewhat makes up for
this slowness. In some cases CrashSimulator will be more efficient than
running the program natively since {\tt rr's} replay does not require
actual execution of most system calls.  This means that CrashSimulator
avoids the system call overheads, such as I/O.
