CrashSimulator uses Mozilla's rr record-and-replay debugger to handle
complex replay situations.

CrashSimulator's supervisor attaches to the processes being replayed at
strategic points in time in order to manipulate system call behavior.

CrashSimulator observes whether or not the application responds to the
modified system call behavior and classifies the application's behavior as
maybe correct or definitely wrong.

CrashSimulator is able to test closed source applications.
