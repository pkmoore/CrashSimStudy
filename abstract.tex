A common problem for software developers
is applications exhibiting
new bugs \textit{after} deployment.
Preventing bugs related to network,
operating system,
file system,
and other similar environmental features is difficult because there
is no way to know how an application will react to every environment.
Enter Simulation of Environmental Anomalies (SEA),
a technique that utilizes evidence
of one applicationâ€™s failure
in a given environment
to predict inadequacies in others.
The technique extracts unusual properties found in communications
between an application and its environment
and simulates them on a running
application.
Exposing other applications to conditions
that caused failure in other cases and noting the response,
offers evidence that a bug may exist.
The technique provides a way to store these anomalies so,
over time,
applications can be tested against
an increasing set of problematic conditions.
We created a concrete implementation called CrashSimulator
and evaluated it against a set of popular Linux applications
selected from Coreutils and the Debian popularity contest.
Our tests found a total of 65 bugs
in 24 applications
with effects including hangs,
crashes,
data loss,
and remote denial of service conditions.
