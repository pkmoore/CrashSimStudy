    % What CrashSimulator Does vs. What This Paper Does
    The sheer scale of software applications in use today, as well as a
    shortage of developer time, necessitate usage of automated testing
    tools in combating bugs.  Today's developers can choose from a huge
    variety of tools with varying degrees of complexity and bug-finding
    capability.  However, adopting a new tool can result in a great deal of
    wasted effort if its learning curve outweighs the value of its results.
    In this work we introduce CrashSimulator -- a tool that identifies bugs
    resultant from unhandled an anomalous conditions present in the
    environment in which an application is executing.  CrashSimulator does
    this by recording, modifying, and replaying the results and side
    effects of the system calls an applications makes.  In order to
    demonstrate that CrashSimulator is worthy consideration by developers
    regardless of skill level this work compares it to two similar tools
    (AFL and Mutiny) in a study of developer's ability to use the tools in
    question to find novel bugs in real world applications.  To facilitate
    this comparison we conducted a study with ZZZ users in which
    participants were asked to use the tools in question to hunt for bugs
    in popular, real-world applications.  This study revealed that
    CrashSimulator's strategy of identifying bugs visible in system call
    sequences is effective and usable for developers with diverse
    backgrounds, across skillsets like software engineering backgrounds.
    Developers with a high degree of proficiency with operating systems
    concepts preferred CrashSimulator's ability to target unusual
    environmental conditions over manipulating applicaiton data inputs.
    Our participants reported that CrashSimulator's additional setup
    complexity was dramatically outweighed by its ability to find new bugs.
    This study was responsible for the identification and reporting of YYY
    novel bugs, ZZZ of which have been since been corrected.  With wider
    use CrashSimulator could help uncover a great deal of previously
    unidentified bugs in new and existing codebases.
