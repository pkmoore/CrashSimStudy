    % What CrashSimulator Does vs. What This Paper Does
    The sheer scale of software applications available today, as well as a
    shortage of developer time, necessitates the use of automated testing
    tools to find and eliminate bugs. Developers can choose from a huge
    variety of tools based on their their varying degrees of complexity
    and/or their bug-finding capabilities.  However, adopting a new tool
    can result in a great deal of wasted effort if its learning curve
    outweighs the value of its results.  In this work we introduce
    CrashSimulator, a tool that identifies bugs created by anomalous
    conditions associated with the environment in which the application is
    executed.  In this way, CrashSimulator allows developers to find
    environmental bugs regardless of their experience with the underlying
    operating systems concepts.

    In order to demonstrate this claim, we directly compare CrashSimulator
    to two similar tools (AFL and Mutiny) in a study with ZZZ users.
    Participants were asked to use the tools in question to hunt for bugs
    in popular, real-world applications.  This study revealed that
    CrashSimulator's strategy of identifying bugs visible in system call
    sequences is effective, and that the tool can be used by developers
    with diverse backgrounds, and across skill sets.  Though developers
    with a high degree of proficiency with operating systems concepts
    preferred CrashSimulator's ability to target unusual environmental
    conditions over manipulating application data inputs, even subjects who
    had little experience did not appear to be overwhelmed by the tool's
    additional setup complexity, and agreed the extra work was dramatically
    outweighed by the tool's ability to find new bugs.  During the study
    YYY novel bugs were identified and reported, ZZZ of which have been
    since been corrected.  By ensuring that even relatively novice
    developers could use CrashSimulator, the tool is poised to help uncover
    a great deal of previously unidentified bugs in new and existing
    codebases.

    of something closer to novice.  Maybe it's me being weird but I was
    imagining my intro to CS student's heads exploding if I asked them to
    figure out CrashSimulator}
