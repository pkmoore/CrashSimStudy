\subsection{AFL}

AFL is a file-based fuzzer.  It is able to take an input file, mutate its
contents, and pass the file along to the application under test.  AFL is
able to manipulate the contents of files only while CrashSimulator is able
to maniupluate other aspects present in the results and side effects of
system calls.

\subsection{Mutiny Fuzzer}

Mutiny fuzzer is a network fuzzer operates by mutating and replaying pcap
recordings of network activity.  The similarities between the operation of
Mutiny and CrashSimulator mean that it is a good candidate for comparison.
The major difference between these two that CrashSimulator can manipulate
aspects of system calls than the messages sent across a network.  Mutiny,
on the other hand, is limited to manipulating the content of messages only.
